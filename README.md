I am an accomplished Ph.D. graduate in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in "Personal Exposure to Air Pollution Using Wearable Monitors" from the University of Colorado Boulder. My academic journey also includes dual Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering, reflecting my commitment to diverse and impactful contributions in the field.

In the academic realm, my research at CU Boulder's Miller Research Group delves into the intricacies of personal exposure to particulate matter air pollution. From managing and analyzing the validation of consumer-grade exposure monitors to studying air quality in disproportionately impacted residential communities, my work extends beyond academia to address real-world environmental challenges.

My professional journey has taken me to prestigious institutions and industries, including roles at Daimler AG and Festo AG & Co. KG in Germany, where I honed my skills in modeling, simulation, and electrical engineering. Additionally, my engagement with the Institute for Modeling Plasma, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT) and the Keplinger Research Group showcased my versatility, covering soft robotics, atmospheric simulations, and more.

I am not just an engineer; I am a dedicated educator, having served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at CU Boulder. My commitment to learning and sharing knowledge extends beyond the academic sphere, earning me grants and recognition for outreach efforts.

In the corporate world, I contributed to the development of innovative solutions in the automotive industry and explored the frontiers of functional safety in powertrain electronics systems. My involvement in the German Culture Society of Colorado and participation in the Femtec Network's career-building program further underscore my commitment to diversity and collaboration.

Proficient in an array of software and programming languages, multilingual, and adept at project management, I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals, explore new opportunities, and contribute my skills to projects that make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of collaboration!
